        <b>Full Spectrum Records</b> releases the works of experimental musicians and sound artists, 
        with an ear towards idiosyncratic tones, extended time frames and unique compositional approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Originally founded in 2008 in Greensboro, North Carolina by Andrew Weathers and Andrew Marino as 
        a means to document their early collaborations, the label has since evolved into a collective community 
        of musicians, experimentalists and artists of various disciplines working in often-overlooked corners 
        of the underground.
    </p>
    <p>
        Presenting artists&rsquo; works via limited physical editions and high quality digital files, Full Spectrum 
        aims to present a wide variety of unique work with minimal concern for genre or branding. Full Spectrum is 
        currently based in Littlefield, Texas and is operated through the collective efforts of Andrew Weathers, 
        Gretchen Korsmo, Carl Ritger, Erik Schoster and many others.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our <b>Editions Littlefield</b> series covers works that deal with a sense of place. In our interpretation, 
        Place can be literal, abstract, or situational. As digital connectivity minimizes geographic barriers and 
        anonymous design aesthetics take precedence over idiosyncratic regionalisms, developing and nuturing awareness 
        of place becomes a vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Llano Discs</b> is intended to be a documentation of experimental music made on the Llano Estacado, a region 
        of West Texas that is our primary headquarters. Hyper-limited CDr editions, handmade packaging, no distribution, 
        no promotion.
    </p> 

    <p>
        Full Spectrum is distributed in the US by The Business, Digitally by Audiomoves. Select releases can be found elsewhere. 
        All releases can be found on our <a href="https://fullspectrumrecords.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp page.</a>
